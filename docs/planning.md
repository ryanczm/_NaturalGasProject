* Use it in conjunction with subregion prices to find relationships. Simple model


## Simple Correlations

* How does lagged delta correlate with prices?
* How does lagged delta correlate with HH delta?

## Modelling

* SD deltas
* SD deltas from neighbours
* Lead-lag effects
* Seasonality effects
